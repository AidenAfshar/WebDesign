# WebDesign
- Stock images used are not final (I tried finding better ones, but just decided I would be better off taking my own photos later)
- At smaller sizes, the first news coverage video looks smaller, it's actually not, but because of it's white border on the sides it looks smaller.
- The area for clicking the instagram button is messed up. I'm not sure why, but you can see the issue by enabling a background color on it.
- There are no Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages, so the privacy policy and terms of use buttons at the bottom do nothing.
